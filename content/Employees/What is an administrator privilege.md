RRepairRabbit has several features. You ( System Admin ) have all privileges to use but, it is not feasible that everyone has access to all the features. So, "System Admin" can decide which privileges are given to whom. 

The categories which have different privileges are: 

1. System Admin  
2. Store Admin 
3. Employee  
4. Customer
