Repair Rabbit has several features. You ( System Admin ) have  all Privileges to use but it is not feasible that everyone should access all the features. So, only System Administrator can decide that which privileges are given to whom.  

There are different categories which have different privileges. 

1. System Admin  
2. Store Admin 
3. Employee  
4. Customer.
