Suppose, you are running a repair business and have a manual process for managing appointments, tickets, stores, inventories, etc. and it becomes messy to manage all those things. At that time RepairRabbit API can help you to build your own customised solution and your own customised UI to serve your needs. 

If you already have a software solution but are not satisfied with it, we’re here to help. Suppose, you have customers' database saved in another system and you want to move that data to the RepairRabbit application, you can use our API to do it. 

You can refer the demo from the following [link](https://gitlab.com/RepairRabbit/quickbooks-integration). Here, we have imported customers from Quickbooks to RepairRabbit through RepairRabbit API.

As RepairRabbit is a polymorphic application, you can use it for multiple purposes. If you just want to manage the inventory of your stores, it can be easily done with the RepairRabbit API.
